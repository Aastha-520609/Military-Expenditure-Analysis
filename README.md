# Data Visualization Project: Military Expenditure Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Tableau workbook for a data visualization project that examines the allocation of individuals' income to military expenditure in different countries. The project covers the years 2000-2022 and focuses on seven countries: India, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, and France.

## Data Source
The data used for this project is collected from the World Bank, a trusted source for economic and demographic data.

## Project Structure
- `excel/`: This folder contains the raw data used for the analysis in an Excel file. It includes GDP per capita, population, military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, GNI, and individuals' income data.
- `tableau/`: In this folder, you'll find the Tableau workbook that was used for data visualization and generating insights.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Collected data for GDP per capita, population, military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, GNI, and individuals' income for the selected countries from the World Bank.

2. **Data Structuring**:
   - Organized the collected data to prepare it for analysis, considering the end visualization result.

3. **Calculations**:
   - Calculated key fields necessary for the analysis:
     - Actual Military Spend
     - Actual Military Spend per Person
     - Percent of Income Spent on Military Expenditure

4. **Data Visualization in Tableau**:
   - Imported the structured data into Tableau for visualization and exploration.

5. **Tableau Dashboard**:
   - Created a Tableau dashboard to provide an overall visualization of the analysis, with a focus on comparing military expenditure as a percentage of individuals' income to past years.

## Software Requirements
To view the visualization and data sheets, you will need the following software:
- Tableau Public Desktop

## Conclusion
From the visualization, we can conclude that:
- Every country, except China, was allocating a higher percentage of their individuals' income to military expenditure from the years 2006 to 2012.
- Subsequently, there has been a gradual decline in the percentage of individuals' income spent on military expenditure for these countries.
- However, in the case of China, there was a different trend. China spent a lower percentage of its individuals' income on military expenditure before 2011.
- Starting from 2011, China's expenditure on military began to increase, and this upward trend has continued over the years.

This project provides insights into the varying patterns of military expenditure as a percentage of individuals' income across different countries over the past two decades. The unique trajectory of China's military spending stands out in contrast to other nations.

**Note**: The data collected for this project is publicly available from the World Bank.
